#  Parameters
#The script should take 2 arguments $source and $destination (for the source and destination folders).

#Functions

#Create a function named CheckFolder that checks for the existence of a specific directory/folder that is passed 
#to it as a parameter. Also, include a switch parameter named create. If the directory/folder does not exist and 
#the create switch is specified, a new folder should be created using the name of the folder/directory that was 
#passed to the function.

      mkdir $path
      Write-Host "($path) doesn't exist and was created"
      $exists = Test-Path $path
   }
   return $exists

}

#Create a function named DisplayFolderStatistics to display folder statistics for a directory/path that is passed 
#to it. Output should include the name of the folder, number of files in the folder, and total size of all files in 
#that directory.

# Main processing <--- what's run during the script

#a) Test for existence of the source folder (using the CheckFolder function).
$sourceexists = Test-Folder $source

if(!$sourceexists){
   Write-Host "The source directory is not found. Script can't continue"

}

#b) Test for the existence of the destination folder; create it if it is not found (using the CheckFolder function 
$destinationexists = Test-Folder $destination -create

#with the â€“create switch).Write-Host "Testing Destination Directory - $destination"
if(!$destinationexists){
   Write-Host "The destination directory is not found. Script can't continue"
   Exit
}

#c) Copy each file to the appropriate destination.
#get all the files that need to be copied
$files = Get-ChildItem $source -Recurse | Where-Object {!$_.PSIsContainer}

#c-i) Display a message when copying a file. The message should list where the file is being
foreach ($file in $files){
   $ext = $file.Extension.Replace(".","") # used to search for a specific extension
   $extdestdir = "$destinatio\$ext"

#moved from and where it is being moved to.





#d) Display each target folder name with the file count and byte count for each folder.
